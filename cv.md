Contributed to and led multiple research projects. A summary of some of the 
projects:<br/>
* _Interpretable models of stimulus-response mapping_: modeling the response of 
neurons in the au- ditory cortex to sound stimuli is traditionally done using 
linear spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRF) because of their 
interpretability. We leveraged the power of deep neural networks and a 
Jacobian-based model interpretation method to introduce the dynamic STRF 
(dSTRF). We used this method to discover new dynamics of the stimulus-response 
mapping in the auditory cortex.
* _Analyzing temporal context of stimulus-response mapping_: a fundamental 
characteristic of a time- series model is the temporal extent of the stimulus 
that it integrates to form its response. We used a method developed for 
studying temporal integration in biological systems to study a specific 
artificial system – automatic speech recognition. We discovered how the model 
changed its temporal integration window in different conditions.
* _A neural data processing toolbox_: we developed a python package for 
preprocessing and analyzing time-series neural data like electrocorticography, 
especially in response to auditory stimuli.
* _Linguistic components of speech processing_: in the speech processing pathway 
of the human brain, linguistic representations of the heard speech emerge in a 
hierarchy. We used manually extracted linguistic features of the speech 
stimulus and a ridge regression method to determine how different levels of 
linguistic information are coded in different brain regions. We then compared 
these results to the linguistic representation computed on an automatic speech 
recognition model, analyzing the similarities (and differences) of the brain 
and the artificial model.

Analyzed local field potential (LFP) and single unit activity (SUA) recorded 
from the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys as they were attending to a 
visual attention task, to determine the relationship between features 
extracted from simultaneously recorded LFP and SUA.
