# About

I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University and
a member of the [Neural Acoustic Processing Lab](http://naplab.ee.columbia.edu/) which 
is a part of the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. I am interested in the 
processing of speech and language in the human brain. Specifically, I use machine 
learning methods to study how the human auditory cortex analyzes the acoustic and 
linguistic content of speech as it is processed through the auditory pathway.
