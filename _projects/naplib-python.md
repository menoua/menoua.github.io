A python toolbox for analyzing neural data such as electrocorticography (ECoG) 
or electroencephalography (EEG) paired with acoustic stimuli, `naplib-python` 
aims to facilitate the easy processing and analysis of neural-acoustic data - 
i.e., neural recordings collected from sensory systems in response to auditory 
stimuli. The collection of algorithms and methods in the package can be used 
with a wide variety of data modalities, enabling the easy transfer of methods 
and code between researchers in the field of auditory neuroscience.

This package was built by the [Neural Acoustic Processing Lab](
http://naplab.ee.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I contributed to its 
design, development and maintenance. We primarily use it for processing neural 
data coming from ECoG and EEG in order to study the auditory cortex.
